# Python Programs

A small collection of beginner Python scripts demonstrating basic input/output and control flow.

## Overview
- `Calculator.py`: Simple interactive calculator that accepts two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Handles division-by-zero.
- `Guessingame.py`: A small word-guessing game where the user has up to three attempts to guess the secret word.
- `translator.py`: A tiny text transformer that replaces vowels with the letter `g` (preserves case).

## Files & Usage

- `Calculator.py`:
  - Description: Prompts for two numbers and an operator, then prints the result.
  - Run: `python Calculator.py` and follow the on-screen prompts.

- `Guessingame.py`:
  - Description: Plays a guessing game with the hard-coded secret word `python`. The user has three attempts.
  - Run: `python Guessingame.py` and enter guesses when prompted.

- `translator.py`:
  - Description: Contains a `translate(phrase)` function that replaces vowels in `phrase` with `g` (uppercase vowels → `G`). Prints the transformed phrase for user input.
  - Run: `python translator.py` and enter a phrase when prompted.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Notes
- These scripts are intentionally simple and run in the terminal interactively.
- Feel free to open issues or submit improvements via pull requests.
